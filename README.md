# WishKids
According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, children between the ages of 8 and 18 spend more than seven and a half hours a day online using their smartphones, computers, televisions, or other devices. Therefore, we thought of creating a website to make children interactively aware of the environment. Primary education is a crucial stage in the development of a person's behaviour, social awareness, and altruism. At school, we learn the values and behaviours that stay with us throughout adulthood and define who we are. That is why it is so important for children to have an interest in caring for and protecting the environment while in school. EcoWish hopes this will help build an eco-friendly community.
